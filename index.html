     <h2>Invasion of Poland</h2>
     <h3>September 01, 1939</h3>

     <p>On this day in 1939, German forces bombard Poland on 
     land and from the air, as Adolf Hitler seeks to regain lost 
     territory and ultimately rule Poland. World War II had begun.</p>

     <p>The German invasion of Poland was a primer on how Hitler 
     intended to wage war–what would become the “blitzkrieg” 
     strategy. This was characterized by extensive bombing early 
     on to destroy the enemy’s air capacity, railroads, communication 
     lines, and munitions dumps, followed by a massive land invasion 
     with overwhelming numbers of troops, tanks, and artillery. Once 
     the German forces had plowed their way through, devastating 
     a swath of territory, infantry moved in, picking off any remaining 
     resistance.</p>

     <p>Great Britain would respond with bombing raids over Germany 
     three days later.</p>

     <h3>May 1940</h3>

     <p>In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops 
     on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British 
     and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated 
     from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that 
     could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, 
     Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.

     <h2>Battle of Britain</h2>
     <h3>July 10, 1940</h3>

     <p>The Battle of Britain started on July 10th, 1940. It lasted 
     many months as the Germans continued to bomb Britain.</p>

     <p>Germany needed to prepare for the invasion of Britain, so 
     they first attacked towns and army defenses on the southern 
     coast. However, they soon found that Britain's Royal Air Force 
     was a formidable opponent. The Germans decided to focus 
     their efforts on defeating the Royal Air Force. This meant they 
     bombed airport runways and British radar.</p>

     <p>Although the German bombings continued, the British did not 
     stop fighting back. Hitler began to get frustrated at how long it 
     was taking to defeat Great Britain. He soon switched tactics and 
     started bombing large cities including London.</p>

     <h2>Midway</h2>
     <h3>May 1941</h3>

     <p>Six months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States defeated 
     Japan in one of the most decisive naval battles of World War II. Thanks 
     in part to major advances in code breaking, the United States was able 
     to preempt and counter Japan’s planned ambush of its few remaining 
     aircraft carriers, inflicting permanent damage on the Japanese Navy. 
     An important turning point in the Pacific campaign, the victory allowed 
     the United States and its allies to move into an offensive position.</p>

     <p>Analysts often point to Japanese aircraft losses at Midway as eliminating 
     the power of the Imperial Navy’s air arm, but in fact about two-thirds of 
     air crews survived. More devastating was the loss of trained mechanics 
     and aircraft ground crews who went down with the ships. Some historians 
     see Midway as the turning point in the Pacific theater of the war, after 
     which Americans rode straight to Tokyo; others view it as a cusp in the 
     war, after which initiative hung in the balance, to swing toward the Allies 
     in the Guadalcanal campaign. Either way, Midway ranks as a truly 
     decisive battle.</p>

     <h2>Stalingrad</h2>
     <h3>Sept. 1942 - Feb. 1943</h3>

     <p>The Battle for Stalingrad was fought during the winter of 1942 to 1943. 
     In September 1942, the German commander of the Sixth Army, 
     General Paulus, assisted by the Fourth Panzer Army, advanced on the 
     city of Stalingrad. His primary task was to secure the oil fields in the 
     Caucasus and to do this, Paulus was ordered by Hitler to take Stalingrad. 
     The Germans final target was to have been Baku.</p>

     <p>In early September 1942, the German Army advanced to the city. 
     The Russians, already devastated by the power of Blitzkrieg during 
     Operation Barbarossa, had to make a stand especially as the city 
     was named after the Russian leader, Joseph Stalin. For simple reasons 
     of morale, the Russians could not let this city fall. Likewise, the Russians 
     could not let the Germans get hold of the oil fields in the Caucasus. 
     Stalin’s order was “Not a step backwards”.</p>

     <p>Despite resistance in parts – such as a Kursk – they were in retreat on the 
     Eastern Front from February 1943 on. In his fury, Hitler ordered a day’s 
     national mourning in Germany, not for the men lost at the battle, but 
     for the shame von Paulus had brought on the Wehrmacht and Germany. 
     Paulus was also stripped of his rank to emphasise Hitler’s anger with him. 
     Hitler commented:</p>

     <p>“The God of War has gone over to the other side.”</p>

     <h2>Battle of the Bulge</h2>
     <h3>Dec. 16 1944 - Jan 16, 1945</h3>

     <p>The Battle of the Bulge (December 16, 1944–January 16, 1945), also known as 
     the Ardennes Offensive, was the largest battle fought on the Western Front in 
     Europe during World War II; it is also the largest battle ever fought by the United 
     States Army. It was a German offensive intended to drive a wedge between 
     the American and British armies in France and the Low Countries and recapture 
     the port of Antwerp in The Netherlands to deny the Allies use of the port facilities. 
     The German codename for the buildup to the offensive was Watch on the Rhine 
     (Wacht am Rhine). The actual offensive was codenamed Operation Autumn Mist 
     (Unternehmen Herbstnebel). It fell far short of its goals but managed to create a 
     bulge in the American lines 50 miles wide and 70 miles deep, which gave the 
     struggle its alliterative name. The phrase “battle of the bulge” already existed in 
     the American lexicon as a term for attempts to lose body weight.</p>

     <p>The initial German attack force consisted of more than 200,000 men, around 
     1,000 tanks and assault guns (including the new 70-ton Tiger II tanks) and 1,900 
     artillery pieces, supported by 2,000 aircraft, the latter including some Messerschmitt 
     Me 262 jets. In the opening phases of the battle, they would be facing only some 
     80,000 men, less than 250 pieces of armor and about 400 artillery guns. Many of 
     the American troops were inexperienced; the German force included battle-
     hardened veterans of the tough fighting on the Eastern Front, but they, too, had 
     green units filled with boys and with men who normally would have been considered 
     too old for military service.</p>

     <p>By this time, the Nazi offensive was running out of fuel, literally and figuratively. The 
     Germans had waited for bad winter weather to launch their attack, to diminish the 
     ability of Allied aircraft to support the ground troops. The weather also slowed the 
     German advance, however, and this, the narrow roads and stubborn resistance 
     wrecked their timetable. Improving weather conditions allowed Allied planes to 
     take to the skies again and support the counterattacks that began pushing back 
     the Germans. Despite a Luftwaffe offensive in Holland and a second major ground 
     offensive the Germans launched in Alsace on January 1, the Third Reich could not 
     regain the initiative. The Battle of the Bulge is officially considered to have ended 
     January 16, exactly one month after it began, although fighting continued for some 
     time beyond that date. By early February, the front lines had returned to their positions 
     of December 16.</p>

     <h2>D-Day Invasion</h2>
     <h3>June 6, 1944</h3>

     <p>D-Day: The Invasion of Normandy. On June 6, 1944 the Allied Forces of Britain, 
     America, Canada, and France attacked German forces on the coast of 
     Normandy, France. With a huge force of over 150,000 soldiers, the Allies attacked 
     and gained a victory that became the turning point for World War II in Europe.</p>

     <p>Eisenhower selected June 5, 1944, as the date for the invasion; however, bad weather
     on the days leading up to the operation caused it to be delayed for 24 hours. On the 
     morning of June 5, after his meteorologist predicted improved conditions for the following 
     day, Eisenhower gave the go-ahead for Operation Overlord. He told the troops: “You are 
     about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many 
     months. The eyes of the world are upon you.”</p>

     <p>For their part, the Germans suffered from confusion in the ranks and the absence of celebrated 
     commander Rommel, who was away on leave. At first, Hitler, believing the invasion was a feint 
     designed to distract the Germans from a coming attack north of the Seine River, refused to 
     release nearby divisions to join the counterattack. Reinforcements had to be called from 
     further afield, causing delays. He also hesitated in calling for armored divisions to help in the 
     defense. Moreover, the Germans were hampered by effective Allied air support, which took 
     out many key bridges and forced the Germans to take long detours, as well as efficient Allied 
     naval support, which helped protect advancing Allied troops.</p>

     <p>By the end of August 1944, the Allies had reached the Seine River, Paris was liberated and the 
     Germans had been removed from northwestern France, effectively concluding the Battle of 
     Normandy. The Allied forces then prepared to enter Germany, where they would meet up with 
     Soviet troops moving in from the east.</p>

     <p>The Normandy invasion began to turn the tide against the Nazis. A significant psychological blow, 
     it also prevented Hitler from sending troops from France to build up his Eastern Front against the 
     advancing Soviets. The following spring, on May 8, 1945, the Allies formally accepted the 
     unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. Hitler had committed suicide a week earlier, on April 30.

     <h2>Iwo Jima</h2>
     <h3>Feb. 19, 1945</h3>

     <p>The Battle of Iwo Jima was an epic military campaign between U.S. Marines 
     and the Imperial Army of Japan in early 1945. Located 750 miles off the coast 
     of Japan, the island of Iwo Jima had three airfields that could serve as a staging 
     facility for a potential invasion of mainland Japan. American forces invaded the 
     island on February 19, 1945, and the ensuing Battle of Iwo Jima lasted for five weeks. 
     In some of the bloodiest fighting of World War II, it’s believed that all but 200 or so 
     of the 21,000 Japanese forces on the island were killed, as were almost 7,000 Marines. 
     But once the fighting was over, the strategic value of Iwo Jima was called into question.</p>

     <p>Battles raged on in the northern part of Iwo Jima for four weeks, with Kuribayashi essentially 
     setting up a garrison in the mountains in that part of the island. On March 25, 1945, 300 of 
     Kuribayashi’s men mounted a final banzai attack.</p>

     <p>The American forces sustained a number of casualties, but ultimately quelled the attack. 
     Although the American military declared that Iwo Jima had been captured the next day, 
     American forces spent weeks on end trudging through the island’s jungles, finding and 
     killing or capturing Japanese “holdouts” who refused to surrender and opted to continue 
     fighting.</p>

     <p>Dozens of Americans were killed during this process. Two Japanese holdouts continued to 
     hide in the island’s caves, scavenging food and supplies until they finally surrendered in 1949, 
     almost four years after the end of World War II.</p>

     <p>In the end, neither the U.S. Army nor the U.S. Navy was able to use Iwo Jima as a World War II 
     staging area. Navy Seabees, or construction battalions, did rebuild the airfields for Air Force 
     pilots to use in case of emergency landings.</p>

     <h2>Okinawa</h2>
     <h3>April 1, 1945</h3>

     <p>The Battle of Okinawa was the last major battle of World War II, 
     and one of the bloodiest. On April 1, 1945—Easter Sunday—the 
     Navy’s Fifth Fleet and more than 180,000 U.S. Army and U.S. Marine 
     Corps troops descended on the Pacific island of Okinawa for a 
     final push towards Japan. The invasion was part of Operation Iceberg, 
     a complex plan to invade and occupy the Ryukyu Islands, including 
     Okinawa.</p>

     <p>As dawn arrived on April 1, morale was low among American troops as 
     the Fifth Fleet launched the largest bombardment ever to support a troop 
     landing to soften Japanese defenses.</p>

     <p>Japan’s 32nd Army, some 130,000 men strong and commanded by Lt. Gen. 
     Mitsuru Ushijima, defended Okinawa. The military force also included an 
     unknown number of conscripted civilians and unarmed Home Guards known 
     as Boeitai.</p>

     <p>The kamikaze suicide pilot was Japan’s most ruthless weapon. On April 4, the 
     Japanese unleashed these well-trained pilots on the Fifth Fleet. Some dove 
     their planes into ships at 500 miles per hour causing catastrophic damage.
     About 7,000 Japanese soldiers surrendered, but many chose death by suicide. 
     Some jumped from high hills, others blew themselves up with grenades.</p>

     <p>Winning the Battle of Okinawa put Allied forces within striking distance of Japan. 
     But wanting to bring the war to a swift end, and knowing over 2 million Japanese 
     troops were awaiting battle-weary American soldiers, Harry S. Truman chose to 
     drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6.</p>

     <h2>Siege of Berlin</h2>
     <h3>April 29, 1945</h3>

     <p>In the early hours of 29 April the Soviet 3rd Shock Army crossed the Moltke bridge and 
     started to fan out into the surrounding streets and buildings.[83] The initial assaults on 
     buildings, including the Ministry of the Interior, were hampered by the lack of supporting 
     artillery. It was not until the damaged bridges were repaired that artillery could be moved 
     up in support.[84] At 04:00 hours, in the Führerbunker, Hitler signed his last will and testament 
     and, shortly afterwards, married Eva Braun.[85] At dawn the Soviets pressed on with their 
     assault in the south-east. After very heavy fighting they managed to capture Gestapo 
     headquarters on Prinz-Albrechtstrasse, but a Waffen-SS counter-attack forced the Soviets to 
     withdraw from the building.[86] To the south-west the 8th Guards Army attacked north across 
     the Landwehr canal into the Tiergarten.</p>

     <p>On the night of 1/2 May, most of the remnants of the Berlin garrison attempted to break out 
     of the city centre in three different directions. Only those that went west through the Tiergarten 
     and crossed the Charlottenbrücke (a bridge over the Havel) into Spandau succeeded in 
     breaching Soviet lines.[103] Only a handful of those who survived the initial breakout made 
     it to the lines of the Western Allies—most were either killed or captured by the Red Army's outer 
     encirclement forces west of the city.[104] Early in the morning of 2 May, the Soviets captured 
     the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken 
     to see General Vasily Chuikov at 08:23, where Weidling ordered the city's defenders to surrender 
     to the Soviets.</p>

     <p>The 350-strong garrison of the Zoo flak tower left the building. There was sporadic fighting in a few 
     isolated buildings where some SS troops still refused to surrender, but the Soviets reduced such 
     buildings to rubble.</p>

     <h3>August 6, 1945</h3>

     <p>On August 6, 1945, during World War II (1939-45), an American B-29 bomber 
     dropped the world’s first deployed atomic bomb over the Japanese city of 
     Hiroshima. The explosion wiped out 90 percent of the city and immediately 
     killed 80,000 people; tens of thousands more would later die of radiation exposure. 
     Three days later, a second B-29 dropped another A-bomb on Nagasaki, killing 
     an estimated 40,000 people. Japan’s Emperor Hirohito announced his country’s 
     unconditional surrender in World War II in a radio address on August 15, citing the 
     devastating power of “a new and most cruel bomb.”</p>

     <p>At noon on August 15, 1945 (Japanese time), Emperor Hirohito announced his country’s 
     surrender in a radio broadcast. The news spread quickly, and “Victory in Japan” or “V-J Day” 
     celebrations broke out across the United States and other Allied nations. The formal surrender 
     agreement was signed on September 2, aboard the U.S. battleship Missouri, anchored in Tokyo Bay.
